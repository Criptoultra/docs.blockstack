## Additional requirement and option

Sending and receiving Stacks (STX) does require a Bitcoin account. You also have the option to use the wallet with or without a hardware wallet.  

### Bitcoin account for fuel (required)

You need very small fractions of Bitcoin to fuel your Stacks Wallet transactions. For example, .00025 Bitcoin can fuel several transactions. You can acquire this Bitcoin fuel and send it to the Stacks Wallet via a Coinbase or other Bitcoin account. Before you begin using the wallet transactions, make sure that you have such an account. You must create this account yourself.

### Hardware wallet (optional but recommended)

If you have a paper wallet or a custodial wallet, you should set up a secondary hardware. You can then transfer small amounts to this hardware wallet for use with your Stacks Wallet. You can use any of these hardware wallets with the Stacks Wallet:

* <a href="https://trezor.io/" target="\_blank">Trezor</a> One
* <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="\_blank">Ledger</a> Nano S
* Ledger Blue 

{% include note.html content="Blockstack only supports the hardware wallets listed above.  Other wallets, for example, the Trezor Model T, <strong>are not supported</strong>.  If you have questions about wallet support, please <a href='emailto:support@blockstack.org' target='_blank'>contact Blockstack support</a>." %}

For information on setting up a hardware wallet, refer to the vendor's
documentation. We cannot help you set up your hardware wallet.
